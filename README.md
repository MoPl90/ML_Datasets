# Welcome to my ML Datasets Repository ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction
This is a collection of datasets that I have come across on various occasions, some of them in job interviews, workshops, or just by browsing the web. I provide some data science code with the datasets, but there is no guarantee for completeness or functionality. This is meant as a purely educational project.
